## Scheduling

### Cron (Linux / macOS)

Epic usually refreshes free games every Thursday:

```bash
# Every Thursday at 00:30
30 0 * * 4 cd /path/to/epic-free-games && node src/index.js --claim >> /tmp/epic-free-games.log 2>&1
```

### GitHub Actions

1. Fork this repository
2. Open Settings → Secrets and add: `EG_EMAIL`, `EG_PASSWORD`, `EG_OTPKEY`, `WEBHOOK_URL`
3. Enable the Actions workflow

### OpenClaw Skill

See [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md)

## How It Works

```text
Query free games ──→ Check ownership ──→ Auto claim ──→ Send notification
  (public API)         (authenticated)     (browser automation)   (webhook)
```

### Authentication

On the first run, a browser window opens so you can log in manually. Cookies are stored in `data/browser-profile/` and reused later in headless mode. When the session expires, the script will notify you to log in again.

### Captcha Handling

The script now treats Captcha as an **explicit terminal state** instead of retrying blindly:

- Captcha is recorded as `captcha_blocked`
- Blind retries stop automatically to avoid further damaging the same IP / profile
- Screenshots, reasons, and `details` are saved and included in structured notifications
- Results are written to `claimed.json` for later investigation

To reduce Captcha triggers, it is recommended to:

- use a clean residential IP
- avoid aggressive retry loops
- keep a stable browser profile / session

## Docker

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose run epic-free-games node src/index.js --login   # Login
docker compose up                                               # Auto-claim
```

---

## Multi-Account

Create `data/config.json`:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    { "email": "user1@example.com", "password": "pass1", "otpkey": "" },
    { "email": "user2@example.com", "password": "pass2", "otpkey": "SECRET" }
  ]
}
```

Each account gets its own browser profile.

## FAQ

**Getting `Not logged in`**  
Run `node src/index.js --login`

**Captcha appears every time**  
Try switching to a clean residential IP first. The script now marks this state as `captcha_blocked` and stops blind retries. If needed, delete `data/browser-profile/` and log in again.

**Seeing `payment_iframe_timeout` / `place_order_not_found` in logs**  
These usually indicate a page flow problem, not necessarily Captcha. Check `claimed.json` for `reason`, `details`, and `screenshotPath`.

**Browser crashes / page closes unexpectedly**  
Make sure the machine has enough memory (roughly 500MB or more). The script now records `page_closed` separately so screenshot failures no longer hide the root cause.
